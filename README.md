Heart Disease Prediction Using Neural Networks

This project aims to predict the presence of heart disease in individuals based on various health-related attributes. Leveraging machine learning techniques and neural networks, we developed a predictive model capable of accurately classifying individuals at risk of heart disease.

Components Used:

Data Preparation and Exploration: We utilized Pandas for data loading and preprocessing tasks, ensuring the dataset was properly formatted and cleaned. Exploratory data analysis techniques were applied to gain insights into the distribution and relationships among the features.

Neural Network Development: Our model architecture was implemented using TensorFlow and Keras. It comprised input, hidden, and output layers, with appropriate activation functions and dropout regularization to prevent overfitting.

Hyperparameter Optimization: To enhance the model's performance, we employed Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to search for optimal hyperparameters. This involved tuning parameters such as learning rate, number of hidden layers, neurons per layer, and dropout rate to minimize validation loss.

Model Evaluation and Interpretation: We evaluated the trained model's performance using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall. Additionally, we interpreted the model's decisions to identify significant predictors of heart disease using techniques like feature importance ranking.

Deployment and Documentation: The project was implemented in Jupyter Notebook, providing an interactive environment for experimentation and analysis. We documented the entire process, including methodology, findings, and recommendations, ensuring transparency and reproducibility.

Usage:

To run the project:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE.
3. Ensure all dependencies are installed (`pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `tensorflow`, `pyswarm`, etc.).
4. Run the main script to preprocess the data, train the neural network model, and evaluate its performance.
5. Experiment with different hyperparameters or modify the model architecture to further improve performance.
